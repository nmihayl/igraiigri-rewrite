# igraiigri-rewrite

The following repository hosts an attempt at a rewrite of the Bulgarian version of the flash game portal Roundgames (IgraiIgri). As it stands, the current version is in rough shape as the original website's codebase is near impossible to maintain which prompted this rewrite.

## Hosting

The original page is available here:

- [igraiigri.com](https://www.igraiigri.com/)

A mirror of the original page is here:

- [igraiigri.helliolab.giize.com](https://playground.helliolab.giize.com/)

The current development version of the rewrite is available here:

- [playground.helliolab.giize.com](https://playground.helliolab.giize.com/)

Note that the rewrite is not in a usable state; this Git repo is primarily for ease of development and version control. Currently games are playable with Ruffle, although accessing them via navigating the page is not possible as of yet.
